# CSE-302-Project-Part-II

## Overview
This repository contains the second part of a comprehensive project that extends my exploration of data structures through practical application to the Iris Flower dataset. This segment focuses on the theoretical applications of advanced data structures and demonstrates proficiency in handling complex data analysis and manipulation tasks.

## Project Description
In this phase, I delve deeper into the Iris Flower dataset, applying advanced data structures to achieve two main objectives:
- **Exploration of Theoretical Applications**: Discussing potential uses of advanced data structures beyond basic lists, including Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Priority Queues, to address specific data analysis challenges.
- **Implementation of an Advanced Data Structure**: Demonstrating practical data handling through the adaptation of a chosen advanced data structure for a simple input/output task related to the dataset.

## Theoretical Applications

### Application 1: BST for Modified Iris Records
I propose organizing the Iris dataset into a self-balancing BST, keyed on `SepalLengthCm`. This structure would allow for efficient querying of records based on sepal length, facilitating quick identification of outliers and in-depth analysis of sepal length variation among Iris species.

### Application 2: Priority Queue for Risk Analysis
By augmenting the Iris dataset with a computed "risk" variable—derived from attributes like `SepalWidthCm` and `PetalLengthCm`—a Priority Queue could serve as an effective tool for prioritizing Iris samples by risk level. This approach would optimize the investigation process, focusing attention on samples with notable deviations or patterns indicative of environmental stress factors.

## Implementation Highlights
This repository showcases my ability to not only conceptualize the application of advanced data structures but also to implement these concepts practically. Through careful selection and adaptation of data structures like BSTs and Priority Queues, I demonstrate a nuanced understanding of data manipulation and analysis techniques, underscoring the relevance of these structures in real-world data science tasks.
